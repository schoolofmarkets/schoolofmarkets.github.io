    content: I came to know about this course through Instagram and enrolled myself.The
      video lectures are simple to understand yet makes us learn the complexity of
      the markets. I saw the website and then understood that this is not a overnight
      millionaire crash course rather a step by step approach towards it. I never
      hesitated to contact Arvind to clear my doubts and he never fails to get back
      to you. I am more than satisfied with this course and would happily refer others

  headline: <a name="FAQ"><h3>FAQs</h3></a>
  content: "<br> <strong> Do video lectures actually work?</strong><br><em>There is
    this big misconception that a live face to face session is better, but, with a
    cloud based series, people have consistently reported better understanding to
    us, and you can replay it any number of times. With the modern day needs and skewed
    work-life balance, you can Binge like Netflix. Just that, you learn here, than
    just laughing along to a recorded laugh track on a retarded sitcom.</em><br><br>
    <strong> How to do the enrolment process?</strong><br><em>Go to the respective
    Courses from the top, and register for the course. You'd get the course sent to
    you, within 24 hours.</em><br><br><strong> How much profit can I make?</strong><br><em>This
    is the wrong question. The right question would be how much you are willing to
    risk. If you are willing to take minimal risk, you can make 10% per trade very
    easily.(Which our Masterclass specialises in) If you're willing to risk more of
    your capital, sky is the limit. We've had people making 30 times!(Though we strictly
    never recommend it)</em><br><br><strong> Can I get a Discount?</strong><br><em>Really?
    Take a look at our prices. We'd gladly price our courses for ₹5, if we were selling
    samosas<br>(On second thought, quality matters, so, even that would be at least
    ₹15). The courses have far more value than courses that are sold for over ₹50
    thousand.</em><br><br><strong> How much capital will I need?</strong><br><em>There
    is no requirement of any minimum capital, only a mind to learn is required. But,
    we would suggest at least ₹5 thousand to start with.</em>"
