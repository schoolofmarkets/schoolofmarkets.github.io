    content: <img src="/uploads/2020/04/15/Asset 1.png"><br>                    <br>The
      video lectures are simple to understand yet makes us learn the complexity of
      the markets. Came to know through Instagram. Never hesitated to contact Arvind
      to clear my doubts and he never fails to get back. I'm more than satisfied and
      would definitely recommend this!

    content: <img src="/uploads/2020/04/16/Asset 4.png"><br><br>For someone who was
      a more than a little skeptical about stock trading, this course really helped
      me.A ton of appreciation to Arvind for making sure that I am not listening to
      a very rigid professional course but rather like listening from my friend who
      has experience in it. There are a lots of excercise and activities for us to
      do which makes us put some practical aspect from the learning we gained.

  headline: <a name="FAQ"><h3>FAQs</h3></a>
  content: "<br> <strong> Do video lectures actually work?</strong><br><em>There is
    this big misconception that a live face to face session is better, but, with a
    cloud based series, people have consistently reported better understanding to
    us, and you can replay it any number of times. With the modern day needs and skewed
    work-life balance, you can Binge like Netflix. Just that, you learn here, than
    just laughing along to a recorded laugh track on a retarded sitcom.</em><br><br>
    <strong> How to do the enrolment process?</strong><br><em>Go to the respective
    Courses from the top, and register for the course. You'd get the course sent to
    you, within 24 hours.</em><br><br><strong> How much profit can I make?</strong><br><em>This
    is the wrong question. The right question would be how much you are willing to
    risk. If you are willing to take minimal risk, you can make 10% per trade very
    easily.(Which our Masterclass specialises in) If you're willing to risk more of
    your capital, sky is the limit. We've had people making 30 times!(Though we strictly
    never recommend it)</em><br><br><strong> Can I get a Discount?</strong><br><em>Really?
    Take a look at our prices. We'd gladly price our courses for ₹5, if we were selling
    samosas<br>(On second thought, quality matters, so, even that would be at least
    ₹15). The courses have far more value than courses that are sold for over ₹50
    thousand.</em><br><br><strong> How much capital will I need?</strong><br><em>There
    is no requirement of any minimum capital, only a mind to learn is required. But,
    we would suggest at least ₹5 thousand to start with.</em>"
